Minbox - A minimal Coreutils implementation

It is so minimal, most of the code is under 100 lines. 
Minbox is worked on almost every day.

List of things currently implemented:
	LS - missing all flags, supports listing other directories than the current
	CAT - missing all flags
	PWD - missing all flags
	TTY - missing all flags
	WHOAMI - missing all flags
	MKDIR - missing all flags
	RMDIR - missing all flags
	TOUCH - missing all flags

BUILDING:
	to build, just run make and it will build all of the executables in the Makefile's directory. To run all of the tests just run make test. To remove all the executables instantly, run make clean.
